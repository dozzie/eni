== ENI ==

IMPORTANT NOTE: this project uses custom file format, and as such, it's
deprecated. It's recommended to use an already popular format, like TOML.
A TOML parser by the same author as ENI can be found here:
  http://dozzie.jarowit.net/trac/wiki/TOML

ENI is a configuration format based on dead-simple INI known from DOS and
Windows. ENI is a superset of (one of the variants of) INI -- ENI additionally
supports Erlang terms in config.

ENI is not intended to be used inside typical Erlang application. There is
already well established practice of keeping default configuration in `*.app'
file and customizing it by setting environment.

ENI is meant mainly for maintainers writing tools that interact with system
administrator. Such tools usually are scripts for starting a daemon or
command line tools, standalone or for issuing commands to a daemon.

== Examples ==

Usage examples:

  % loading config from file
  {ok, Conf} = eni:file("file.eni"),
  % loading config from in-memory string
  {ok, Conf} = eni:string("..."),

  {Opts, Sections} = Conf,
  Foo = proplists:get_value(foo, Opts),
  BarSect = proplists:get_value(bar, Sections),
  Bar_Baz = proplists:get_value(baz, BarSect).


Short example of ENI file:

  ; traditional INI comment
  # more "unixish" comment
  % and "erlangish" comment

  pid_file = /var/run/erl_daemon.pid
  enabled_services := [http, https].

  [http]
  bind = 127.0.0.1
  port := [8080, 8880].

  [https]
  bind := any.
  port = 8443
  ssl_cert = /etc/erl_daemon/cert.pem
  ssl_key  = /etc/erl_daemon/key.pem
